# 👋 Hello, I'm Deniz Gökduman

Welcome to my professional space where I share insights, experiences, and technical knowledge about **PostgreSQL Database Administration**.

## Who Am I?

I'm a **PostgreSQL Database Administrator** specializing in:
- High Availability (HA) architectures with Patroni
- Performance tuning and query optimization
- Backup, recovery, and disaster recovery planning
- Database security and compliance
- Monitoring and automation

Currently working at **Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM)**, I manage mission-critical database systems that serve millions of users daily. My focus is on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance database infrastructures** that ensure business continuity.

## What I Write About

On this blog, you'll find:

**📚 Technical Guides & Tutorials**  
Step-by-step instructions for PostgreSQL installation, configuration, and administration tasks.

**⚡ Performance & Optimization**  
Real-world strategies for query tuning, indexing, partitioning, and resource management.

**🔒 Security & Compliance**  
Best practices for database hardening, access control, and audit logging.

**🛠 High Availability & Disaster Recovery**  
Implementing Patroni clusters, streaming replication, and backup strategies.

**🤖 Automation & Scripting**  
Bash, PowerShell, and Python scripts to automate routine DBA tasks.

**📊 Monitoring & Observability**  
Setting up Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools for database health tracking.

## Why This Blog?

This blog serves three purposes:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributing to the PostgreSQL community by sharing solutions to common challenges
2. **Personal Archive**: Creating a searchable reference for my own learning journey
3. **Professional Growth**: Building a portfolio that demonstrates my expertise and continuous learning

## My Philosophy

> "A well-maintained database is invisible to users but critical to business success."

I believe that great database administration combines technical expertise with operational discipline. Every configuration decision, every query optimization, and every backup strategy should be driven by business requirements and measured by tangible outcomes.
