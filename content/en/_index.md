## 👋 Hello, I'm Deniz!

On this page, I’ll be sharing my notes and experiences on my journey as a **Database Administrator (DBA)** and **Full Stack Developer**. This way, I aim to both track my progress and build an archive I can revisit whenever I need guidance.

I am currently focusing on **PostgreSQL** and **Oracle**, improving my skills in **high availability (HA)**, **performance tuning**, **backup & recovery**.

In the world of data, we are responsible for every step — from storing and protecting it to delivering it to the user. Such a comprehensive responsibility naturally requires involvement in almost all stages of the process.

🎯 My goal is to design **scalable, secure, and high-performance database systems** that put data at the heart of business solutions.

I also develop **automation tools with Bash, Batch, and PowerShell**, making systems more efficient and secure. In addition, I have past experience as a **Full Stack Developer**, which allows me to work confidently both on the **data layer** and the **application side**.

🤞 I hope this learning journey will be an enjoyable one for everyone who follows along.
